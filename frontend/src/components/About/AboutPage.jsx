            Welcome to MyPlace. A project born from the creative minds of five
            passionate individuals. <br />
            Meet our team: Alina Ermakova, Rikie Patrick, Roberto Quadraccia,
            Claudia Alves, and Yasien Watkin. <br />
            MyPlace is the result of two intense weeks at Makers boot-camp,
            where we embarked on a journey to create a travel map like no other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our vision was to provide a platform where users could curate their
            own personal travel experiences. We faced exciting challenges in
            bringing our vision to life, from integrating Mapbox to developing a
            seamless user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            With MyPlace, you can save your favourite destinations, both those

            places, and connect with fellow travellers. Join us in creating your
